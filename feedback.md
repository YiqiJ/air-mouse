Running Watch:	May have difficulty in calculating double integrals to capture certain information in the graph. If you want to do this, at least show in the proposal what calculation you'll actually be performing from the three accelerometer inputs (and perhaps the magnetometer too).

Reaction Game:	Sounds like a feasible project, it's good that it's very board-focused and seems to use different aspects of what we've learned this semester. Doable, but you might want to find something more challenging.

Doodle Jump Game:	Worry is that the game is too software heavy and there won't be much emphasis on the board. If you want to do this idea, get more involved with the board and see how else you can better involve the board.
